# Twitter_Bot

Each file is a class in this python project. Note this project cannot be run because of the missing config file which hides all the Twitter bot API information. The bot scrapes Twitter for the specified politicans and determines the overall sentiment of their twitter posts (good/bad). This can then in future projects be upscaled to determine whether certain affiliations, politicans of certian sized cities, or other factors influence whether they tweet more positivity or negativity. 

Key project features:
* Web scraping Twitter with a bot
* Preprocessing raw user data 
* Training the bot on a set of pre-labeled tweets
* Testing the bot on never before seen tweets (but with hidden pre-labels)
* Determining sentiment using nltk toolkit 
* Evaluating how good/bad the bot did at guessing
